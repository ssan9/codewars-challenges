// Which of the two lines of code below is more efficient? Explain your answer.

// document.getElementById( "logo" );
// or

// $( "#logo" );

The first line of code, which is pure JavaScript without jQuery, is more efficient and faster. Executing the second line of code, which is jQuery, will trigger a call to the JavaScript version.

jQuery is built on top of JavaScript and uses its methods under the hood to make DOM manipulation easier, at the cost of some performance overhead. It is a good idea to remember that jQuery is not always better than plain old JavaScript. Always consider whether using jQuery really provides a useful advantage for your project.
