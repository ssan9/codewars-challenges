// What selector would I use to query for all elements with an ID that ends with a particular string? Also, how would I modify the selector to retrieve only <div> elements whose IDs end with that same string? Provide an example.

Let’s say you want to retrieve all elements whose IDs end with “txtTitle”. This could be done using the following selector:

$("[id$='txtTitle']")
To retrieve only <div> elements whose IDs end with “txtTitle”, the selector would be:

$("div[id$='txtTitle']")
